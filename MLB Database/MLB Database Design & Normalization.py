# # Designing Database for Major League Baseball
# 
# For this assignment I will be working with a file of [Major League Baseball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball) games from [Retrosheet](http://www.retrosheet.org/). Retrosheet compiles detailed statistics on baseball games from the 1800s through to today. The main file I will be working from game_log.csv, has been produced by combining 127 separate CSV files from retrosheet, and has been pre-cleaned to remove some inconsistencies. The game log has hundreds of data points on each game which I will normalize into several separate tables using SQL, providing a robust database of game-level statistics.
# 
# In addition to the main file, I have also included three 'helper' files, also sourced from Retrosheet:
# 
# - park_codes.csv
# - person_codes.csv
# - team_codes.csv
# 
# These three helper files in some cases contain extra data, but will also make things easier as they will form the basis for three of our normalized tables.
# 
# I will begin exploring the data by using pandas to read and explore the data. Setting the following options after I import pandas is recommendedâ€“ they will prevent the DataFrame output from being truncated, given the size of the main game log file:

# In[1]:


import sqlite3
import pandas as pd
import csv

pd.set_option('max_columns', 180)
pd.set_option('max_rows', 200000)
pd.set_option('max_colwidth', 5000)


# ## Understanding data
# 
# ### Log Dataset

# In[2]:


log = pd.read_csv("game_log.csv",low_memory=False)
print(log.shape)
log.head()


# In[3]:


log.tail()


# #### Insights:
# 
# Looking at the data from the game_log file we can see there are over 170,000 rows, meaning each row represents a game that has been played.
# 
# Details on each game:
# 
# - Game date range: 1871 to 2016
# - Individual player stats
# - Game stats
# - Team stats
# - Refree information
# - Awards such as who performed better or won/loss
# 
# ### Person dataset

# In[4]:


person = pd.read_csv('person_codes.csv')
print(person.shape)
person.head()


# In[5]:


person.tail()


# #### Insights
# 
# This dataset shows us individual people's information of whether they were a player, a manager, a coach or an umpire. This is probably a mass directory that links people with IDs anout when they debut in their respective position.
# 
# Manager's are seen as Head Coaches, where as a Coach is more specializaed such as a batting coach or pitching coach.
# 
# ### Park dataset

# In[6]:


park = pd.read_csv('park_codes.csv')
print(park.shape)
park.head()


# In[7]:


park.tail()


# #### Insights
# 
# This dataset is about the locations of the stadiums being used for the games. There is also information about possible nicknames of the stadiums.
# 
# ### Team Codes Dataset

# In[8]:


team = pd.read_csv('team_codes.csv')
print(team.shape)
team.head()


# In[9]:


team.tail()


# #### Insights
# 
# This dataset provides information about the team mainly about their history and location. There is an interesting column franch_id which I will explore more in detail next.

# In[10]:


team["franch_id"].value_counts().head()


# It is interesting that some franch_ids may be occuring for more than one team. 

# In[11]:


team[team["franch_id"] == 'BS1']


# It looks like that the franchise ids remain the same but the team city changes similarly corresponding to the start and end date, while keeping the nickname. This must mean they move to a new city to relocate which is common in U.S. sports.
# 
# **Leagues**
# 
# The baseball league normally has two main leagues the American (AL) and the National (NL).

# In[12]:


log["h_league"].value_counts()


# It is clear the AL and the NL are the main leagues but there are still a few leagues worth learning more about.

# In[13]:


def league_info(league):
    league_games = log[log["h_league"] == league]
    earliest = league_games["date"].min()
    latest = league_games["date"].max()
    print("{} went from {} to {}".format(league,earliest,latest))

for league in log["h_league"].unique():
    league_info(league)


# Now we have some years which will help us do some research. After some googling we come up with:
# 
# - NL: National League
# - AL: American League
# - AA: American Association
# - FL: Federal League
# - PL: Players League
# - UA: Union Association

# ## Looking for Normalization Opportunities
# The following are opportunities for normalization of our data:
# 
# - In person_codes, all the debut dates will be able to be reproduced using game log data.
# - In team_codes, the start, end and sequence columns will be able to be reproduced using game log data.
# - In park_codes, the start and end years will be able to be reproduced using game log data. While technically the state is an attribute of the city, we might not want to have a an incomplete city/state table so we will leave this in.
# - There are lots of places in game log where we have a player ID followed by the players name. We will be able to remove this and use the name data in person_codes
# - In game_log, all offensive and defensive stats are repeated for the home team and the visiting team. We could break these out and have a table that lists each game twice, one for each team, and cut out this column repetition.
# - Similarly, in game_log, we have a listing for 9 players on each team with their positions - we can remove these and have one table that tracks player appearances and their positions.
# - We can do a similar thing with the umpires from game_log, instead of listing all four positions as columns, we can put the umpires either in their own table or make one table for players, umpires and managers.
# - We have several awards in game_log like winning pitcher and losing pitcher. We can either break these out into their own table, have a table for awards, or combine the awards in with general appearances like the players and umpires.

# Now that I have added all of the tables that don't have foreign key relationships, I will add the next two tables. The game and team tables need to exist before the two appearance tables are created.
# 
# Here are some notes on the normalization choices made with each of these tables:
# 
# - team
#  - The start, end, and sequence columns can be derived from the game level data.
# 
# - game
#  - We have chosen to include all columns for the game log that don't refer to one specific team or player, instead putting those in two appearance tables.
#  - We have removed the column with the day of the week, as this can be derived from the date.
#  - We have changed the day_night column to day, with the intention of making this a boolean column. Even though SQLite doesn't support the BOOLEAN type, we can use this when creating our table and SQLite will manage the underlying types behind the scenes (for more on how this works refer to the SQLite documentation. This means that anyone quering the schema of our database in the future understands how that column is intended to be used.
